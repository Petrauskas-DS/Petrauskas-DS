Data Scientist | Revenue Analytics | Probabilistic Modeling | Simulation

I build quantitative models that support decision-making under uncertainty.  
My work sits at the intersection of statistical modeling, machine learning, and simulation-based forecasting.

## Philosophy

I’m interested in problems where uncertainty matters and probabilities must be taken seriously.  
Well-calibrated models and structured simulation are more valuable than high headline accuracy.
